# The-Simon-Game
Hey!
This has been one of the most interesting project from which I gained a lot of insights as to how we add javascript to our work, making it more dynamic than ever. 
This game was very popular in the 90s because of its simple construct yet the addiction that comes with it...
.

.
The game can begin by pressing any key. 
So essentially the program blinks randomly in one of the color tiles and the player has to remember and press the same colour tiles. 
For every correct order of pressing, player advances to the next round where the number of color tiles to remember increases by one. 

If we make a single incorrect order of pressing the tiles, the game terminates immediately and you can start from the beginning by pressing any key. 

Hope you like it!  
Thanks :)
